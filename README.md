# Visual Recognition
Soon to be renamed to Machine Learning repo.

## How to run
### Virtual environment
First of all, create a virtual environment to manage all your pip dependencies:
```
virtualenv environment
```

And then activate the environment:
```
source environment/bin/activiate
```

And then pip install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to go.

### Run the code
I recommend using jupyter notebook to run my code. Go to the notebooks section of each project, and then run
```
jupyter notebook
```

Your default browser will open up a new tab and it be pretty self-explanatory.

### Run unit tests
Go to each directory and enter
```
nosetests
```
